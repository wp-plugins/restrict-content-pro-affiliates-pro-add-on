Provides an integration between Restrict Content Pro and Affiliates (Light or Pro).

== Description ==

This is an add-on plugin for [Restrict Content Pro](http://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/) that provides an integration for the [Affiliates](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates/) plugin from [itthinx](http://profiles.wordpress.org/itthinx/).

With this add-on you will be able to have affiliates register on your site and receive referral earnings anytime they refer a user that signs up for a paid membership.

This add-on works with both the [free](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates/) and [Pro](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-pro/) version of the Affiliates plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Ensure you have the Affiliates (pro or light) configured correctly. Consult the documentation for those plugins if you are unsure about setup
3. There is no setup for this add-on, just activate and use

When Affiliates is configured, you will see referrals in the plugin's dashboard anytime a member is referred and signs up for a paid membership.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Can this plugin do recurring referrals?

No, referral earnings are tracked on the first payment only.

2. Who do I talk you about configuring Affiliates (Pro or Light)?

[itthinx](http://profiles.wordpress.org/itthinx/) is the developer that wrote both versions of the Affiliates plugin, so please talk to him about problems or questions with either plugin.
